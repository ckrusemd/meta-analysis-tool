RESULTS: Five-year mortality could be predicted with good accuracy (test AUC of .85 [.73; .97], sensitivity 78%, specificity 89% at a probability cut-off of 22.3%) using a Bayesian generalized linear model. Three-year incident severe immobility could be predicted with fair accuracy (test AUC .74 [.57; .91], sensitivity 67%, specificity 78% at a probability cut-off of 14.2%) using a multivariate adaptive regression splines model.
